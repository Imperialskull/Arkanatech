Arkanatech
==========

The line between magic and machine is blured as the arcane and metal are melded together

Arkanatech is a minecraft mod combining two of my previous projects Synthcraft and Aetherwind.
I have decided to merge the elements of synthetic materials and the arcane in the Blender of Awesome
to create a unique play experience that is: Functional, Fun, and plays nice with other mods.

Planned materials
=================

Polymers: thermoplastics, styrene (for clear plastics), rubber ,resins, epoxies, and vulkanized rubbers/plastics.

Synthetic fibers: Kevlar, and rayon (others will be added soon)

Composites: Concrete, Wattle and daub(bricks),Graphite, and numerous others.

Derived materials: Silicon, salt, and Lime; but others are bound to show up.

Elementally attuned ores: Pyreite, Aquium, Territe,Aerium, Lunarite, Solarium.

Alloys: Such as Bronze, Pyroelectrum, Dwarfsteel, Mythril, Chronochrome, etc.

Crafting extension
==================

Arkanatech will feature several "machines" to extend the crafting experience of minecraft.

The Microwave: a furnace alternative inspired by TehKrush's microwave in Plasticraft, the
microwave can be powered by conventional and arcane means and doesn't have power decay.

Metallurgic Filtrator: is a device that seperates slag into usable components, this
leads to less loss in production.

Kaolin Furnace: This device melts metals into liquid form for further processing via
the mould injector.

Mould Injector: Takes liquid materials and fills premade moulds, this allows you to make
tools and armour out of materials you normally couldn't.

Extraction Furnace: Powered by conventional or arcane means, the extraction furnace can reach
and sustain temperatures much higher than the regular furnace. The extraction furnace can 
"sweat" off valuable ore and also not consume the (possibly) valuable leftover slag.

Engraving Table: The engraving table can be used for several uses such as runecrafting,
and augmentation through the not yet implemented runic system.



Items, tools, and other Knick-knacks
====================================

Plastic tools: plastic tools are low-mid tier (pre-Iron) tools; while they are durable they lack
the density of higher grade tools. They also have very limmited potential for enchantment.

The Plaxel: a plastic "paxel" tool that is effective against anything a plastic pickaxe, axe, or
shovel would be effective against.

Mortar and Pestle: a simple device used to crush down ore and other materials without
mechanical aid.

The Synth-Army-Knife: Is a high-tier item, all in one, switchable tool with a shared durablity.
The SAK can be used as a pick,axe,shovel,hoe,sword,bow,shears,or flint and steel.

Obsidian tools: Through use of a Kaolin Furnace and Mould Injector you can cast obsidian into
Durable and hyper-dense, post-diamond tools.

Chain armor: can be crafted using chain moulds in a variety of materials.

Alloy tools and armor: with a variety of effects and materials will be available.

Graphite and NanoShell tools: are powerful synthetic tools (post-diamond)

Star-Heart tools and armor: nothing to see here....move along.

Night-vision-googles: Functional and stylish, our googles will light the way for you if you
forgot your torches (or glowsticks)

World Generation
================
Elementally attuned ores and possibly some more "mundane" ones.

Integration
===========
Our Mod will feature standard configuration options, ore-dictionary support, and liquid-dictionary support.

Aditionally: I will add in support for Arenacraft, Buildcraft, Universal Electricity, Thaumcraft,
and Equivilent Exchange (though I am certain this list will continue to grow)
